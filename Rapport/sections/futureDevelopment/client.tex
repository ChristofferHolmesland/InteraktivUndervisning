\subsubsection{Questions}
Due to limited time, some algorithms and questiontypes where dropped in favor of polishing the application. A natural step forward would to make sure all the algorithms and data structures would have a question format that is was designed for. Some of the algorithms and datastructures that was dropped were: Bellman ford, heaps, stacks, hashtables, list types, etc. Also this application has been designed for the subject algortihms and datastructures, so if another subject wants to use the application, they would be limited to text and multiple choice questions. So a natural step would be to add question types specific for other subjects and fin a way to configure subjects to limit what question types each could have.
