\subsubsection{Questions}
Due to limited time, some algorithms and question types were dropped in favor of polishing the application. A natural step forward would be to make sure all the algorithms and data structures have their own question type. Some of the algorithms and data structures that were dropped: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Bellman ford
	\item Heaps
	\item Stacks
	\item Hashtables
	\item Lists
\end{enumerate}
The application has been designed for the courses DAT200 and DAT110, and therefore if another course wants to use the application, it would be limited to text and multiple choice questions. A natural step is to add question types specific to other courses and finding a way to configure courses to limit what question types each course can use.
