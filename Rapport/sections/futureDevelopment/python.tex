\subsection{Python}
If the Python question type need to be expanded to include either more language features or other type of questions, the custom interpreter should not be used. Maintaining a Python interpreter which always matches the newest version of Python is very time consuming, and a lot of knowledge about programming language development is needed. The CPython interpreter should therefore be used instead. If the interpreter is changed, the components related to Python questions need to be remade. Figuring out how to use the CPython interpeter and remaking the components is time consuming, but it will be easier to maintain because all of the features are included and updated.
