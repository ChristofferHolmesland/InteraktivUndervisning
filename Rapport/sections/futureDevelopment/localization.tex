\subsubsection{Localization}
When creating the locale files, it was designed in such a way that every Vue component has its own object. This has been a design that worked well, but during development, a design flaw was discovered. Some Vue components use the same text. This can, for instance, be seen on buttons and error messages. It could have been solved by not just storing locales divided into Vue components, but by also storing common locale in a separate object. Even though the file size for each locale file is relatively small, it can be reduced more. Another way to expand localization would be to add more locales.
