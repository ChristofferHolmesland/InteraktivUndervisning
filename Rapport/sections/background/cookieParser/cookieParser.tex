\subsection{Cookie Parser}
HTTP does not store any state about who the user sending a request is. A problem resulting from this is that it is not possible to check whether the user is logged in or not. To solve this, cookies can be included in the header field of the HTTP request. In Express the cookies can be accessed by parsing the header field of the request. To make this more straightforward for the developer, a package called cookie-parser\cite{cookie-parser:Info} can be used instead. cookie-parser is a middleware function which retrieves the cookies from the request and places them in the req object of the request handler.
