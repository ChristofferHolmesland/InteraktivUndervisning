\subsection{SQLite3}
SQLite3\cite{sqlite3} is a SQL database engine which doesn't require a separate server process to operate. Instead SQLite3 reads and stores all the data directly to a single stored file. This is one of reasons why SQLite databases are used in a lot of small and medium sized web pages. This is primarily the reason why SQLite was used in this project over other database engines.

By default if you try to connect to a SQLite3 database which doesn't exist it will automatically create a new database file for the requested database. SQLite3 has support for just a few data types such as INTEGER, TEXT and BLOB. However, it does support all SQL features, which makes it both easy and effective to use.
