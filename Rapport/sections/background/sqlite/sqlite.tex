\subsection{SQLite3}
SQLite\cite{sqlite3} is a SQL database engine which does not require a separate server process to operate. Instead, SQLite reads and stores all the data directly to a single stored file. This is one of the reasons why SQLite databases are used in a lot of small- and medium-sized web pages. This is primarily the reason why SQLite was used in this project over other database engines.
