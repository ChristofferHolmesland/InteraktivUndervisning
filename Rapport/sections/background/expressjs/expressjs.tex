\subsection{Express}
A simple web server which only returns a HTML file is fine if the application only contains static files, but if it is more complex, a web framework should be used. Express\cite{express} is a web framework for Node.js. By default, it does not come with many features. It is possible to define handlers for different URLs, and it can start a HTTP server, but its strength is middleware functions. Middleware functions are functions which does something with either the request or response objects before the actual URL route handler function sees them. This design means that Express is very modular and it is only needed to include what will be used. This is why Express was chosen over the simple HTTP server which is available in Node.js. Instead of Express, Meteor\cite{meteor} could have been used. Meteor was not chosen because it works best with websites where a lot of the content is static, which is not true for this application. It also lacks good support for relational databases which is something this application uses.
