\subsection{Connect History Api Fallback}
The website in this project is built as a single page application, which means that there is only one HTML file, and extra content is loaded in using JavaScript when needed. Using the HTML 5 history object\cite{HTML5HistoryObject:Info} the user can be given the illusion that they are visiting other pages on the site. E.g. the URL will show www.site.com/contact instead of www.site.com/index.html. If a user enters the URL www.site.com/contact in their browser, the web server will try to return a file to them called "contact". This file does not exist, and the user will get a 404 error. Connect-history-api-fallback\cite{CHAF:Info} is an Express middleware function which redirects the user request through the HTML file which results in the user seeing the page they expect.
