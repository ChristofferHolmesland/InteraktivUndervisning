\subsubsection{Vue Router}
Vue Router\cite{VUEROUTER} tries to mimic the multipage application, by using routes and views. A route is a mapping from an URL path to a view. Views are Vue components that should be used as a template for a page. This leaves the user with the impression that the single page application acts like a multipage application, but the website feels more smooth and responsive as the webpage does not load in another HTML file. It replaces elements in the DOM using JavaScript.
