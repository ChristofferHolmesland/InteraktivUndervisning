\subsubsection{Vue Router}
Vue router tries to mimic the multipage application by using routes that are URL paths and views that are Vue component that should be used to be the template for a page. This leaves the user with the impression that the single page app acts like a multipage app, but the website feels more smooth and responsive as the webpage don't load in another HTML file. It replaces elements in the DOM using javascript.
