\subsection{Vue}
Vue\cite{VUE} is a framework for building single page applications (SPA) which means the output is a single HTML file and a main JavaScript file. Each component and view have their own JavaScript and CSS file. When the user clicks around on the page, the main JavaScript loads in components or views by adding the content to the HTML file. Then the DOM gets updated with the new components. These updates make navigation and interaction on a webpage feel more smooth and responsive. When programming the client side of the application, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript get their own container inside the Vue file. When compiling a Vue project, the Vue CLI has to be used to make compatible HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files.
