\subsection{Vue}
Vue is a framework in Node.JS for building user interfaces. Vue makes a single page application which makes the load in one HTML file and the javascript and CSS needed for the first page. Then when the user clicks around on the page the main javascript loads in component or views in as more javascript and css. Then the DOM gets updated with the new components. These updates make the navigation and interaction on a webpage feel more smooth and responsive. When programming the client side of the application, the HTML, CSS, and javascript will get its own container inside the Vue file. When you have written the application one needs to use the Vue CLI to compile the code.
