\subsubsection{Vue CLI}
The Vue CLI\cite{VUECLI} is used as a developer tool to start, build, manage and deploy a Vue project. When setting up a Vue project, there are some options to how the project is initialized and which plugins to include. Some of the plugins available help with linting, templating the "pages" and setting up Vue features. One of the plugins that was used in this project is the Vue Router.
