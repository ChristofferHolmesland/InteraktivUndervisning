\subsection{Bootstrap}
This web application is designed to work on both mobile and desktop devices. The different HTML elements needed to be placed depending on what kind of device the user has. In web development, this is called responsive design. Bootstrap\cite{Bootstrap:Info} is a web framework for creating responsive websites. It provides CSS classes which can be used to define the layout of the page and behavior of elements in a responsive environment. CSS for styling elements is also provided. This makes it easier for developers with little design experience to create a consistent style across the entire application. The project BootstrapVue\cite{BootstrapVue:Info} has been used because it contains predefined Vue components which are designed in a way such that they interact well with the Vue reactive DOM. There are many alternatives to Bootstrap, two of them are Materialize.css and pure CSS. Materialize.css is very similar to Bootstrap, but it was not selected because it does not provide any clear advantages over Bootstrap, which the developers were already familiar with. Pure CSS was not picked because a lot of the functionality of Bootstrap would have been recreated, which did not seem like a good use of development time.
