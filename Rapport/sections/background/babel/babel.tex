\subsection{Babel}
When making a web application with JavaScript it is important to remember that different browsers support a different set of JavaScript features. Many new JavaScript features are not fully supported by all of the major browsers, e.g. Google Chrome did not have full ECMAScript 6 support for almost two years after the standard was defined. Some browsers also implement specific features which are only available in that browser. These features are often more performant and should preferably be used by the developer. To make it easier for the developer a tool called Babel\cite{Babel:Info} can be used. Babel parses JavaScript code and makes sure it can run on the specified browsers. If a given browser does not support the code, the Babel tool will replace it with compatible code. In this project, the Babel tool is part of the Vue build process. There are not any alternatives if the goal is to make the code browser compatible. Languages like CoffeeScript and Typescript will compile to JavaScript, but they do not have the same support in Vue as JavaScript does. Since the Vue build process by default includes Babel, it was chosen as the best option for this project.
