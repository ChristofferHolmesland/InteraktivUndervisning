\subsection{ESLint}
When working with a langauge like JavaScript which doesn't check for errors before you run the code, it can be useful to have a tool to detect errors before the program runs. ESLint\cite{eslint} is a linter for JavaScript. A linter is a tool which analyzes code and warns the programmer about errors. When working in a team with several people the code can often get harder to read over time if the developers use different coding styles. To prevent this, it's possible to configure ESLint to also check coding style. This project is configured to use the Prettier\cite{prettier} option which means that coding style will be enforced.
