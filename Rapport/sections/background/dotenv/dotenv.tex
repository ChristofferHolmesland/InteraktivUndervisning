\subsection{Dotenv}
When working on a application which talks to other systems, sensitive information about how to access the other systems are often needed. This can be database login information, or API access keys. This is information that shouldn't be shared with other people and it shouldn't be included in source control. The sensitive information is often stored in environment variables on the system running the application. In Node.js, environment variables can be access from the process.env global object. The variables are passed into this object when the program starts. This is good because then the values are not stored in the source code itself, however this also means that before running the application the variables have to be set every time. Instead the package Dotenv\cite{dotenv} makes it possible to store these variables in a file. Dotenv will parse the file, and load all the variables into the process.env object.
