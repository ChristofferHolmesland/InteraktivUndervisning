\subsubsection{OpenID Connect}
The OAuth protocol was never designed for authentication, it was only designed for authorization and permissions over the web. OpenID Connect\cite{openidconnect} is a layer that was placed on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol in order for OAuth to also be able to handle authentication.

OpenID connect allows OAuth 2.0 to store an ID token, which  will be used to get information about the user. With this extra user information OAuth 2.0 can be safely be used as an authentication protocol. In this project a combination of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect was used in order for the web application to be able to authenticate students through uninett's dataporten\cite{dataporten}.
