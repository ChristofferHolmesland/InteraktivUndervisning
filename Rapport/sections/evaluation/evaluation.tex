\subsection{Vue}
To make the interface between the code and the website simpler, we wanted to use a web framework. We needed a dynamic webpage where the different parts were constantly changing depending on the user interaction. Code seperation was important for us, because we wanted to be able to split it up as much as possible to minify the risk of one error affecting the whole application. We expected Vue to make it easier for us to do this. Code reuse was also important. We knew from the beginning that the questions and solutions were going to be displayed in different places, and we wanted to only write the code for this once. We had previously used templating engines, which let you use JavaScript variables directly in the HTML. This is something we expected Vue to do for us.

Vue met our expectations, and also had a lot of features we didn't know about. We had no experience in making single page applications, so we had a lot to learn. There was also many features we didn't know, that we had to learn. Examples are the vue-router. We didn't consider the fact that when there is only one page, the user can't use the URL bar of the browser to navigate. We had some problems with storing application state between different views and components, but after some searching we found vuex which was made to solve that problem. Our experience is that Vue didn't prevent us from doing anything we wanted, and it provided good solutions to common problems. A lot of time was spent in the beginning trying to learn Vue, but the time investment was worth it considering how much time we would have spent on recreating the same features found in Vue.
