\subsection{Vue}
To make the interface between the code and the website simpler, we wanted to use a web framework. We needed a dynamic webpage where the different parts were constantly changing depending on the user interaction. Code separation was important for us because we wanted to be able to split it up as much as possible to minify the risk of one error affecting the entire application. We expected Vue to make this easier. Code reuse was also important. We knew from the beginning that the questions and solutions were going to be displayed on different pages, and we wanted only to write the code for this once. We had previously used templating engines, which makes it possible to use JavaScript variables directly in the HTML. This is something we expected Vue to do for us.

We had no experience in making single page applications, so we had a lot to learn. Vue met our expectations, and also had many features we did not know about. Examples are the Vue Router. We did not consider the fact that when there is only one page, the user cannot use the URL bar of the browser to navigate. We had some problems with storing application state between different views and components, but after some searching, we found Vuex which was made to solve that problem. Our experience is that Vue did not prevent us from doing anything we wanted to do, and it provided good solutions to common problems. Much time was spent in the beginning trying to learn Vue, but the time investment was worth it considering how much time we would have spent on recreating the same features found in Vue.
