\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion the current application is a web application that gives teachers the ability to create sessions which contain questions that are relevant to a lecture. The application implements all the features from the primary goals for the project. The application supports the use of websockets and can have multiple students participate in a session. The sessions have layout that support both mobile devices and computers, while the admin portion of the application is strictly designed for pc users only. The application has a drawing tool, that is designed to be used both to answer questions and create questions about certain algorithms and data structures in the courses DAT110 and DAT200. The application stores the result of questions and sessions. This data can be used by the teacher to check if students understand the material in the course. Other features such as supporting OpenID Connect for student authorization, student feedback, and localization support were added during the development because these features worked well with the planned structure of the application.

During the development of the application a lot of different tools had to be used. In general, most of the tools were tools that the group had very little to no experience working with. This includes developing single page web applications using Vue, using Socket.IO for the WebSocket functionality of the sessions, and OAuth in order to authenticate students using their Feide users etc. By the end of this project, the group members have gained experience working with these tools, and the group has in general learned a lot more about modern web tools and frameworks. The group has learned a lot about how to structure larger software projects, and working in teams.

One of the challenges with implementing solution checking and generating is that user input can create objects which does not fit with the actual data structure. When answering a question about binary trees, they can create nodes which have more than two children, they can create trees with several roots, or create cycles in the tree. This made it a lot harder to create correct algorithms because there were a lot of edge cases for each question type.
