\subsection{Creating a new course}
For a admin to be able to create a question or a session, or add other admins and student assistants. They will first have to create and select a course. This will be possible to be done on the admin dashboard. There will be a selector that is also present on all other admin views, where the admin can select a course that they have admin rights in. Or they will be able to click a add course button and create a new course. When creating a new course, a title, course code and semester is needed. There will be checks both on the client and on the server checking if the inputed variables are valid or not. If they are not valid a appopriate error message will show up informing what went wrong. Both the course code and semester only needs to be created once. After that it will be stored in the database. The course code is set up to only be a string with 3 capital letters followed by 3 numbers. And the semester is added with either spring or autumn in compination with a year. The year and season is not something the user can edit, and each time the server starts it will add the current year and the three next years to the database. After there is a selected course an admin will be able to add or remove other feide registered users as admin or student assistants.
