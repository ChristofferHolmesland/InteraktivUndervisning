\subsubsection{Server structure}
When setting up the server side, the project got divided into different blocks. Each block would have it sown use case as far as possible. If done correctly there is many benefits by splitting code into different blocks. The standard way of splitting code is to follow SOLID (S: Single responsibility principle, O: Openâ€“closed principle, L: Liskov substitution principle, I: Interface segregation principle, D: Dependency inversion principle). If this is followed correctly it will give the advantages of MURDER(M: Maintainability, U: Understandability, R: Reuseability, D: Debugability, E: Extensibility, R: Regression). Examples of this can be seen in how the socket functions are split up into categories with for example client function, admin functions, feide functions split into their own file and then imported where they are needed. The same can be seen in the database functions, where get, insert, update and delete functions are split into their own files to make development easier.
