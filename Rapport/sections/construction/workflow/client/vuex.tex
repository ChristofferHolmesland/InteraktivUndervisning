\subsubsection{Vuex}
The application's components had some shared variables such as localization and user information. To make sure that all the components accessed the same information, it was stored in a Vuex store. The store contains the following information:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \code{user}. The \code{user} object stores the user's \code{username}, \code{feideId} and \code{userRights} level.
	\item \code{adminSubjects}, which is a list of all the subjects the current user has rights for.
	\item \code{loggedIn} is a boolean which stores whether or not the user is logged in.
	\item \code{locale} is an object which stores information about the selected language in the \code{locale} property, and the available languages in the \code{localeList} property.
	\item \code{courseList} stores all the courses the user has rights for.
	\item \code{selectedCourse} stores the course id of the course the user is currently viewing.
	\item \code{questionTypes} stores every available question type.
\end{enumerate}
