\subsubsection{Camera}
The camera object is responsible for letting the user view only a section of the world at a time, and for converting between canvas and world coordinates. The camera object has a position given by the \code{centerX} and \code{centerY} properties. Depending on the canvas size and the \code{zoomLevel} a section of the world will be rendered. To determine if a node or edge should be drawn, the \code{cull(object, isNode)} method is used. It returns \code{false} if the object is inside the camera view, or \code{true} if the object is outside. An culled object should not be drawn. An node is culled if it is outside the camera view. An edge is culled if both nodes are outside the camera view.
