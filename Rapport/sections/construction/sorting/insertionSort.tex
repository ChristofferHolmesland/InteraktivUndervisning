\subsubsection{Insertion Sort}
Insertion sort is simplest sorting algorithm learned in the algorithms and data structures course. Insertion sort uses an easy algorithm that is forced to go though every entry in a list. The algorithm checks whether or not the current entry has a smaller value then the previous entry, if entry has a smaller value, then the previous entries have to re-sorted with the entry until either you find an entry that is smaller or reach the start of the list.

The insertion sort is quite easy to implement, essentially only consists of a for-loop and a while-loop. Because its simple design its a sorting algorithm that is quite often used. Insertion sort is however quite slow compared to most other sorting algorithms. It only has an O(n) average run time, and a runtime of O($n^2$) in terms of worst case scenario.

Although insertion sort is quite effective when it is used to sort almost fully sorted list's. This means that insertion sort algorithm is used by a lot of other sorting algorithms. Mostly used as a final step in these other sorting algorithms. Examples of this being the sorting algorithms Shell sort, Merge sort and Quick sort.	%Probably have should have a cite to the different sorting algorithms mentioned just now.
