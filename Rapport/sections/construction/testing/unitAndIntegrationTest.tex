All the unit and integration tests can be found in the folder named “tests”. This folder contains the following three folders:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] algorithms
    \item[-] cypress
    \item[-] solutionChecker
\end{itemize}
The algorithms folder has the unit test for the algorithms used in the application. It is primarily used to test whether the algorithms do their intended job. The “test\_sorting” JavaScript file contains unit tests for all the sorting algorithms. The “test\_trees” JavaScript file contains the tests related to the \code{Tree} and \code{BinaryTreeNode} and the functions related to tree objects. This file has a mix of unit and integration tests. The “test\_dijkstra” JavaScript file contains unit tests for the Dijkstra algorithm. The solutionChecker folder has a test for the quicksort solutionChecker. To run all the unit and integration tests input the command \code{npm run Test}. This command must be run in the App directory.
