\paragraph{Cypress}
The end-to-end tests in this project are stored in the "tests" folder, together with the unit-test, but in its own folder with the name "tests/cypress". Running the end-to-end test requires only clicking on any of the files, once the Cypress interface is open and visible. The different test files can be found within the folder named "specs". Every describe function in the test files are counted as their own test suite. It is intended that the end-to-end tests are run using the project's testing environment. In this environment, the server will run on port 8082 instead of 8081. It also requires the user to set up an environment file to test. To build the client in the testing environment, use the \code{npm run buildTest} command. To start cypress and server, use the command \code{npm run cypress:open}.
