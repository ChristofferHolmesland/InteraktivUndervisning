\paragraph{Cypress}
The end-to-end tests in this project are stored in the "test" folder, together with the unit-test, but in its own folder with the name cypress. There are detailed instructions on how to install and starting cypress on the projects README file. Running the end-to-end test requires only clicking on any of the files, once the cypress interface is open and visible. The different test files can be found in the with the name "specs". Essentially all describe functions in the test files are counted as their own test suite. It is intended that the end-to-end tests are run using the project's testing mode. In this mode the server will run on port 8082 instead of 8081. It also requires the user to set up an environment file to test. To build the client for testing mode, use the "npm run buildTest" command.
