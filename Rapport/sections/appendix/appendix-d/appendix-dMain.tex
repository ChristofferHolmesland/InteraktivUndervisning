\section{Python}
Python is a dynamically-typed object-oriented programming language developed by The Python Software Foundation. Dynamically-typed means that it is not necessary to specify the type of variables, because the type is determined at runtime. The syntax is very similar to JavaScript; however, Python uses indentation instead of curly brackets to separate code.

Classes are defined using the \code{class} keyword. Functions are defined using the \code{def} keyword. Methods (functions inside classes) are defined as functions inside a class with the first argument begin a reference to the instance of the class. A class constructor can be added by defining a method with the name \code{\_\_init\_\_}. Example of a class:
\begin{lstlisting}
# This is a comment
class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.age = age
        self.setName(first_name, last_name)

    def setName(self, first, last):
        self.name = first + " " + last

p = Person("C", "H", 88)
\end{lstlisting}
