\subsection{Merge Sort}
The merge sort algorithm is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. The algorithm works by splitting the array into many smaller arrays, sorting the smaller arrays and then merging them back together into a sorted version of the original array. This project contains an implementation which splits the array recursivly until a given limit is hit, or the array size is 1. If the limit is given, the array will be sorted using insertion sort, before merging.
