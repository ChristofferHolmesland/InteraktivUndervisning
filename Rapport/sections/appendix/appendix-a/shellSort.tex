\subsection{Shell Sort}
Shell sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on insertion sort. The key difference between the two sorting algorithms is in performance. Shell sort will have both an average case and a worst case of O(n) runtime. The main reason for this is that shell sort will sort entries in the list that are at certain intervals from each other. The algorithm is essentially dividing list entries into smaller sublists in order to make the sorting more efficient. Through this method, shell sort avoids having to check every entry in the list, which allows the algorithm to remove the main drawback of using insertion sort.

The starting interval used in a shell sort is usually based on approximately half length of the list. The algorithm uses the interval to divide up the entries in the list. The entries chosen together are then compared to each other and sorted based on their value. Once the list has been effectively sorted on the current k-interval, the interval's value is halved and the sorting process starts anew. Eventually, the interval will reach a value of 1, which causes shell sort to finish sorting the list using the insertion sort algorithm. Of course, since the list should at this point be almost completely sorted, and therefore the insertion sort should never achieve a run-time of $O(n^2)$.
