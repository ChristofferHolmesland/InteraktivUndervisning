\subsection{Insertion Sort}
Insertion sort is the simplest sorting algorithm taught in the algorithms and data structures course. Insertion sort uses a simple algorithm that has to go through every entry in a list. The algorithm checks whether or not the current entry has a smaller value than the previous entry. If the entry has a smaller value, then the previous entries have to re-sorted with the entry until either an entry that is smaller is found or the start of the list is reached.

The insertion sort is simple to implement, only consisting of two loops. Because of its simple design, it is a sorting algorithm that is quite often used. Insertion sort is however quite slow compared to most other sorting algorithms. It has an O(n) average run time and a runtime of O($n^2$) in terms of a worst-case scenario.

Insertion sort is quite effective when it is used to sort almost fully sorted lists. This means that a lot of other sorting algorithms uses the insertion sort algorithm. It is usually used as a final step in other sorting algorithms. Examples of this being the sorting algorithms Shell sort, Merge sort and Quick sort.
