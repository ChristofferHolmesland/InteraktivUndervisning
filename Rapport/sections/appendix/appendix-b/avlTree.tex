\subsection{AVL}
%Note might have to change all avl trees to just avl
An AVL tree is a binary search tree, that can balance itself when it is needed. An AVL tree has only 1 condition extra compared to a normal BST. AVL trees can only have a height of 1 or lower difference between the left and right subtree in any of the nodes in the tree. This means for instance that a node that has a left subtree of height 1 and a right subtree of height 3 is not a qualified subtree. In order to keep this height balance between the subtrees, the AVL tree have to rebalance itself by rotating in either the left or right direction.\cite{BinaryTree,AVLTreeRotation:Insertion} \\[11pt]
There are 4 different rotations that can be performed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Left}
	\item{Right}
	\item{Dobbel Left, also referred to as right left rotation}
	\item{Dobbel Right, also referred to as left right rotation}
\end{itemize}
