\subsection{AVL}
%Note might have to change all avl trees to just avl
An AVL tree is a binary search tree, that can balance itself when it is needed. An AVL tree has only one additional condition compared to a normal BST. AVL trees can only have a height of one or lower difference between the left and right subtree in any of the nodes in the tree. This means for instance that a node that has a left subtree of height one and a right subtree of height three is not a qualified subtree. In order to keep this height balance between the subtrees, the AVL tree has to rebalance itself by rotating in either the left or right direction.

There are four different rotations that can be performed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Left}
    \item{Right}
    \item{Double Left, also referred to as right left rotation}
    \item{Double Right, also referred to as left right rotation}
\end{itemize}
