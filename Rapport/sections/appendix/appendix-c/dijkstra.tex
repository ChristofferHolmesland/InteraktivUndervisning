\subsection{Dijkstra}
Dijkstra's algorithm\cite{Dijkstra:Info} is an algorithm that is used to determine the shortest path through a network of nodes (graph) connected to each other by a nonnegative weighted edge. The algortihm has the start and the end node, and works its way through the network keeping track of the current route weight to each node in a table. When doing the next comparison, it will take the current route with the shortest path in the table. Then it looks for edges and their weight and update the table. This is done until all paths to the end node has been explored. When the algorithm is finished, the shortest path has been found.
