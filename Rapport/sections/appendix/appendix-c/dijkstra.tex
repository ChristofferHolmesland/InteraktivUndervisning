\subsection{Dijkstra}
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm that is used to determine the shortest path through a network of nodes (graph) connected by a nonnegative weighted edge. The algorithm has the start and the end node and works its way through the network keeping track of the current route weight to each node in a table. The algorithm keeps a list of processed nodes and a list of unprocessed nodes. For each iteration, it takes the node from the list of unprocessed nodes with the shortest path and processes it. Then it looks for edges and their weight and updates the table. This is done until all paths to the end node has been explored. When the algorithm is finished, the shortest path has been found.
