\subsection{ExpressJS}
ExpressJS is a web framework for NodeJS. It makes it possible to start a HTTP server and lets the programmer create function handlers for different routes on the site. By default it doesn't come with a lot of features, but it has support for middleware functions. Middleware functions are functions which modify the request and response objects of a request. They can also be used to control the flow of the request by calling other middleware functions or returning early.
