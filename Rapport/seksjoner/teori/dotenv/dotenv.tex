\subsection{Dotenv}
Dotenv is a npm package which can be used to load environment variables from a file. In NodeJS environment variables can be read from the process.env global object. API keys and other sensitive information should be put outside the source code, and in environment files which are not part of source control instead. Dotenv reads the environment file and puts the environment variables into the process.env object.
