\subsection{Bootstrap}
Bootstrap is a framework for creating websites. We've used it to design the user interface on our site. In Bootstrap you design your sites using a responsive grid system. The page is divided into 12 columns. You can specify how many columns you want your HTML object to occupy depending on the users screen size, by adding CSS classes to the object. In this project bootstrap-vue was used, because it has the latest features from Bootstrap4, and it provides Vue components that already works with the reactive DOM in Vue.
