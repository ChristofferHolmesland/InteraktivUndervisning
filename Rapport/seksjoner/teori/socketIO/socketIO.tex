\subsection{Socket.IO}
Socket.Io is the most commonly used WebSocket for Node.JS, which makes it the most supported and with the most active community of the alternatives. Socket.IO is built using the ENGINE.IO and creates a connection between the server and the client in real time, with bidirectional event-based communication. In this application, multiple users will send updates to the server, and the server will send out various updates to numerous clients at the same time. This would have been very complicated and time-consuming to get right with AJAX or regular HTTP requests. When a Socket.IO function is set up, it's easy for the functions only to send the information that is meant for that client. Socket.IO also have a feature called "rooms" where the server can add a connection to a virtual room. Then when a quiz is running, and the server needs only to update clients connected to that quiz. It will broadcast it's messages to that room, and then only clients connected to that room will get that message. This makes Socket.IO ideal for making the server handling more than one quiz at the time. Also, all the socket.IO functions are asynchronous which makes the wait time for a response a lot shorter.
