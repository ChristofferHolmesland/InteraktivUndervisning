\subsection{SQLit3}
SQLite3 is a SQL database engine which doesn't require a seperate server process to operate. If you try to connect to a database which doesn't exist it will by default be created for you. Databases are stored in a single file. It has support for just a few datatypes, but supports all SQL features, which makes it both easy and effective to use.
