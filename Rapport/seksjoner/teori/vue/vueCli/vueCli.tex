\subsubsection{Vue Cli}
The Vue CLI is used as a developer tool to start, build, manage and deploy a Vue project. When setting up a Vue project, there are some options to how you want to set it up and what plugins you want to use. Some of the plugins available help with linting, templating the "pages" and setting up Vue features. One of those features that was used in this project is Vue router.
