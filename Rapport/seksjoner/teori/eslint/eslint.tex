\subsection{ESLint}
ESLint is a linter for JavaScript. A linter is a tool which analyzes code and warns the programmer about errors. This project is configured to use ESLint with the prettier option, which means that ESLint will also analyze the code format and warn about formatting errors. This makes ESLint a good tool for finding bugs and enforcing a common coding style which makes the code easier to read in a project where multiple people work on the same code.
