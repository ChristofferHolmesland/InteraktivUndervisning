\subsection{NodeJS}
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime which makes it possible to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It comes with a lot of functionality which lets you use the terminal window as a console, access the file system, access the operating system and much more. It also provides a command line tool called npm, node package manager. It can be used to install node packages in your project. Node packages are code other people have written and published. This tool makes it easier to not "reinvent the wheel".
